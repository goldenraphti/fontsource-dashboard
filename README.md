# Fonts Dashboard

## Roadmap

- [ ] make mobile responsive
- [ ] add more fonts
- [ ] add possibility to add tags to fonts (e.g. elegant, modern, playful, quirky, tech, etc.)
- [ ] add possibility to create "collections" of fonts. Like, when you're preparing a project, but you're doing a preselection of fonts you might want to use but haven't completely decided yet. (e.g. map-the-world, personal blog, music festival website, etc.)
- [ ] SEO
- [ ] add about page
  - [ ] add section about privacy (explain it's all local)
- [ ] add contact page
- [ ] add credits page
- [ ] marketing
- [ ] add feature possible for users to suggest new quality fonts to be added to the dashboard

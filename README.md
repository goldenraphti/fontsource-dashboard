# Fonts Dashboard

## Roadmap

- [ ] UI if scroll down then the font-preview-cusrors div becomes fixed at the bottom of the viewport
- [ ] make mobile responsive
- [ ] can hide the ones we don't want to see in the see of filtered fonts
- [ ] give a UI hint to on clicking on the preview it shows some more details
- [ ] improve the preview cursors UI by making it that if scrolled out of view then become fixed at bottom (kind of like the Astro dev toolbar)
- [ ] improve style of top nav when hover give a UI hint (some color, make it fun)
- [ ] add possibility to add tags to fonts (e.g. elegant, modern, playful, quirky, tech, etc.)
- [ ] add possibility to create "collections" of fonts. Like, when you're preparing a project, but you're doing a preselection of fonts you might want to use but haven't completely decided yet. (e.g. map-the-world, personal blog, music festival website, etc.)
- [ ] SEO
- [ ] add this project to the GitHub bio & the blog side-projects list
- [ ] add about page
  - [ ] add section about privacy (explain it's all local)
- [ ] add contact page
- [ ] add credits page
- [ ] marketing
- [ ] add feature possible for users to suggest new quality fonts to be added to the dashboard
- [ ] can we optimize the font load by loading only subset (not sure if the Astro Font experimental API offers that as of now, but when possible then it'd be great to save bandwidth and speed up load times)
- [ ] make it a PWA
- [ ] add dark mode toggle
- [ ] add animations/transitions to make it feel more alive
- [ ] add ability to switch between grid view and list view
- [ ] add ability to sort fonts by different criteria (e.g. popularity, date added, alphabetical, etc.)
- [ ] add ability to search fonts by tags
- [ ] add ability to preview custom text input by the user
